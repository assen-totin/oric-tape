This is a small programme which coinverts a data file (usually a tape or disk
image) into a sound representation (WAV file).

The produced WAV file can then be played via a standard PC sound card and fed
to the tape (cassette deck) input of any old 8-bit PC.

The WAV file is encoded as if if was written by the 8-bit PC at 300 bps (
usually callsed 'slow' mode). Hence, the PC should be set to loading in slow 
mode.

The encoding used is taken from the Oric Atmos PC, but may be useful for other
1980's PCs. The ofrmat is explained inside the source file and can easily be
modified if needed.
