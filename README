This is a small programme which converts a data file (usually a tape or disk
image) into a sound representation (WAV file) and back.


DATA-TO-WAV CONVERSION
======================

Use od2w. Give it the source and target file names. It will produce a 44.1 kHz 
mono WAV file from your data file.

The produced WAV file can be played via a standard PC sound card and fed to 
the tape (cassette deck) input of Oric Atmos 8 bit PC (or any of its clones 
like Pravetz 8D).

The WAV file is encoded as if it was written by the 8-bit PC at 300 bps 
(usually callsed 'slow' mode). Hence, the PC should be set to loading in slow 
mode. For Oric, load with the following comand: 

CLOAD "",S

The actual data will be preceded by a few seconds of Oric sync sequence, 0x16. 
Do note that Oric expects some header information rearding the content type
(BASIC code, machine code etc.), autoplay (on or off) and memory address to
load the programme to; you have to provide this header in your data file. 


WAV-TO-DATA CONVERSION
======================

Use ow2d. Give it a source and target file names. It will produce a binary 
representation of your WAV file.

The WAV file can be recorded from the audio output of Oric Atmos. The WAV file 
should be 44.1 kHz, mono. It should begin with the Oric Atmos sync sequence
(several seconds of 0x16) followed by the Oric header. Only if these two are
present the decoding will be successful. 

The recording should be done in 'slow' mode (300 bps). For Oric Atmos, the 
command to save the file is:

CSAVE "SOME_PROG_NAME",S

Regarding saving BASIC programs, do note that Oric stores the program operators
not by their name (e.g., PRINT), but by thei relevant hex code. The ow2d will 
not convert such hex codes back into BASIC operators; you should do this 
manually if you need it.
